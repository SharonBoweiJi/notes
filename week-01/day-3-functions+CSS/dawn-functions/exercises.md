#Function Challenges
    

##1.  You're a Thermometer, Harry!
Create two functions that convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit, and Fahrenheit to Celsius.  The functions should output the converted result to the console using the `console.log()` method.  The below formulae will convert the temperatures, respectively.

**Converting Celsius to Fahrenheit**

`°Fahrenheit = °Celsius × 9/5 + 32`

**Converting Fahrenheit to Celsius**

`°Celsius = (Farenheit - 32) × 5/9`

Here are the expected function prototypes: 

`function convertToCelsius(temp);`

`function convertToFahrenheit(temp);`
##Thermometer Stretch Challenge
Combine both functions above into one function.  Manipulate the functions to take a second parameter which would inform the function the temperature *type* it is receiving.  

Also implement the Kelvin temperature scale in your function as a choice.  A third parameter might be needed to inform the function  what output temperature type is desired.

**Converting Celsius to Kelvin**

`Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15`

**Converting Fahrenheit to Kelvin**

`Kelvin = (Fahrenheit + 459.67) × 5/9`

**Converting Kelvin to Celsius **

`Celsius = Kelvin - 273.15`

**Converting Kelvin to Farenheit **

`Fahrenheit = Kelvin × 9/5 - 459.67`

##2.  The Great Comparator
Create a function that compares two integers, a and b, and returns a numerical value indicating if a is greater, less than, or equal to b.  This function will be used as a *helper* function for future module challenges.

Specs:

* Use assertions to validate that the parameters passed into the function are integers
* If a is grater than b, return a positive number
* If a is less than b, return a negative number
* If a and b are equal, return a zero 

Here's an expected function prototype:
 
`function compare(a, b);`

##Comparator Stretch Goal
Extend your function to accept Strings as well as Integers.  The function will need to detect the type of parameter passed in and determine what logic will need to be performed. Assume that a and b will be both Strings or both Integers. Use the above Specs as a guideline for your implementation.  The same function prototype will apply.


##3.  A man, a plan, a canal: Panama!  
Create a function that accepts a string as input and returns a boolean true if it is a palindrome (same spelling forwards and backwards) and false if otherwise.  You may use built-in String and array methods within this function.  

Here's an expected function prototype:
 
`function isPalindrome(a);`

Notice that the function begins with the word is.  Best practice reminds us to prefix any function with a boolean return with a 'has', 'is', or other similar deliniation.  

Specs:

* You may use array manipulation, String manipulation, or a combination of both
* Only test using single words

##Palindrome Stretch Goal
Extend your function to successfully test phrases (without punctuation.)  In the test, blank spaces should not be considered in comparing the forwards and backwards forms of hte phrases.

##Extra Stretchy Goal
Alter your function to only use a single traversal (one loop) of the phrase using any built-in String or array methods EXCEPT reverse.  Hint: Research loops!
